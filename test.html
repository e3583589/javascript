            Hi, my name is Marion Odhiambo. I am taking this class because I not only want to learn web development, but this course is also required for my degree plan as a future web designer. I have only just begun to get my feet wet in the world of web development using IntelliJ and Kotlin, but I’m really excited to gain more core knowledge in other programming languages like JavaScript. I’ve been told that JavaScript is one of the hardest programming languages to understand, but I’m curious to see how much I can grasp when it comes to web design using JavaScript.
